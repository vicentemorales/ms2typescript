# react-views

Render React components server side. This module was originally designed to work with Koa and io.js, but should work anywhere Promises are implemented.

## Usage

```javascript
var app    = require('koa')();

var engine = require('react-views')({
  path: './views',
  cache: false // default = true
});

app.use(function * () {
  this.body = yield engine.render('layout');
});
```
